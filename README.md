# Regression-Hoeffding-Tree-
A regression tree that is able to perform regression tasks. It can be a Hoeffding Tree with two modifications: instead of using information gain to split, it uses variance reduction; and instead of using majority class and naive bayes at the leaves, it uses target mean, and the perceptron.
